                                                                           Collection Tracker

This is an application that was created using Java, Spring framework, MySql to interact with a database, and Thymeleaf in order to dynamically interact 
with user's inputs.

The purpose of this application is to allow users to keep track of the various items they collect. In my case I have a large book collection - which this 
implementation is centered around but can easily be changed to accomodate different catagories of items (coins, paintings, etc). It eventually becomes harder 
to keep track of the various items in your possession which makes future purchases complicated since you are unsure if you already possess the desired item or not. 
To physically have to search for the item is troublesome as they might be stored in different locations, or simply too time consuming since the collection is 
comprised of a great number of items. Here comes the CollectionTracker, which keeps track of the various items in your collection and presents you with the ability
to easily find out whether or not you already have an item or not as part of your collection. You can also keep track of various details, such as their location 
(if you want that sort of information to be specified, it is an optional feature), the author (in the case of books) or inventor of an item and so on.

This application also uses a login/registration system in order to make sure that your collection tracker is not meddled with by others.
